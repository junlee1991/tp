* This is **an application for car repair shop owner **.<br>
  Example usages:
  * keeping track of which vehicle belongs to which customer
  * scheduling of technicians
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AutoM8_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `AutoM8` because it was initially created as a part of a series of `AutoM8` projects (`Level 1`, `Level 2`, `Level 3` ...).
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[AutoM8 Product Website](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103-W17-4/tp)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.
